# HSIC-and-Learning-without-EBP
This project is an implementation of the Hilbert-Schmidt Independent Criterion (HSIC) for Information Bottleneck Loss in training deep neural networks without error backpropagation (EBP). For this implementation, the method described in [1] is used, and TensorFlow is employed for training layer-by-layer in a forward flow of the network.

In addition to the original method, some new ideas are added to this work for better performance, such as L1 norm regularization.

## Instructions
Details of code are explained in various cells of Implementation.ipybn notebook.
